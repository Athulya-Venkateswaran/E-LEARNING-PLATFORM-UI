DOMAIN: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION: As part of my internship project, I developed a mini E-Learning Platform using core front-end web development technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a user authentication system (login and register), a course listing interface, video embedding, and a fully functional quiz module with a timer and scoring system.This platform demonstrates how basic educational web apps can be created using fundamental technologies without relying on complex frameworks. The code was written and tested entirely using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), which provided an efficient and developer-friendly environment for coding, debugging, and styling the application.

Tools and Technologies Used:
HTML5: Used for structuring the web pages including login, register, home, and quiz pages.
CSS3: Employed for styling the pages and creating a visually appealing and responsive layout using color schemes, button styles, shadows, and progress bars.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Added interactivity, user data handling (via localStorage), timer logic, quiz functionality, score calculation, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
Visual Studio Code (VSCode): The primary code editor used, known for its extensions, live preview, and powerful syntax highlighting.
LocalStorage API: To store and retrieve registered user data on the browser side without a backend.
YouTube Embed: A learning video is embedded using an iframe to simulate a course video module.

Project Structure and Functionality:
The project consists of the following main components:
a) Login & Register System
Users can register using a username and password, which are then stored in the browser's local storage.On the login page, entered credentials are validated against the saved data.Upon successful login, users are redirected to the home page.If incorrect credentials are entered, users receive an alert message.

b) Home Page
Features a navigation bar with a “Start Quiz” button styled like a modern call-to-action button.Displays a course list with progress bars to simulate the tracking of learning progress.An embedded video acts as a tutorial or lecture component, enhancing the multimedia learning experience.

c) Quiz Module
A multiple-choice quiz with 15 questions related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Each question has four options, and only one correct answer.Users receive instant feedback through color changes (green for correct, red for wrong).A countdown timer of 180 seconds is implemented, and the quiz ends automatically when the timer hits zero.A score is displayed at the end of the quiz indicating the total correct answers.

Real-World Application and Use Case.This project is applicable in several real-world scenarios, such as:
E-learning platforms and online course portals like Coursera, Udemy, and Khan Academy, where user management and quiz functionality are essential.
Educational institutions developing internal training tools or digital learning systems for students.
HR training systems in companies to track employee learning and test knowledge through quizzes.
Interview or exam practice apps where users can log in and take time-based practice tests.
Portfolio projects for web developers to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of.User authentication logic using only frontend code, Creating reusable and clean CSS designs with responsiveness, DOM manipulation in JavaScript to create dynamic content, Implementing timers, score tracking, and conditional UI rendering, Using browser storage to simulate database interaction.

This internship task showcases how front-end web technologies can be used to build simple but functional educational web apps. By combining HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity, I created a cohesive and interactive user experience. Visual Studio Code, being a lightweight yet powerful editor, made the development process smooth. This project not only reflects my technical skills but also highlights my ability to understand and implement real-world applications from scratch.
